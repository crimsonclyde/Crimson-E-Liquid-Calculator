            CrimsonClydes E-Liquid Calculator


There are thousands of web calculators and a bazillion of apps for iOS and Android.
But, I believe the world needs a shell based e-liquid calculator.
E-liquid is the mixture used in electronic cigarettes.

Shell is good, but whats better is shell spiced with some fancyness!
Based on newt we use whiptail to create a widget based user interface.
